# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository shape

GeoLibre is a single **npm workspaces monorepo** (`apps/*`, `packages/*`, `workers/*`) plus two non-npm components: a Python FastAPI sidecar (`backend/geolibre_server`) and a separate Python package (`python/`, the `geolibre` Jupyter anywidget). One `npm install` at the root wires up every JS workspace. Use **npm** (the repo tracks `package-lock.json`), Node **22+**.

The same React app ships three ways: native desktop via **Tauri v2** (`apps/geolibre-desktop/src-tauri`), a browser web build served by nginx (Docker), and embedded in Jupyter (the `python/` package bundles a build of the web app into its wheel).

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev            # web dev server → http://localhost:5173
npm run tauri:dev      # desktop app (required for filesystem dialogs, local MBTiles, local raster reads)
npm run build          # production web build → apps/geolibre-desktop/dist/
npm run tauri:build    # desktop installers → apps/geolibre-desktop/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/
npm run typecheck      # alias for the full build (tsc -b && vite build) — writes to dist/, not a pure type-check
npm run ci             # full local gate: build + frontend + worker + backend + rust check
```

Tests:

```bash
npm run test:frontend                              # node --test over tests/*.test.ts (tsx loader)
npm run test:frontend:coverage                     # same, plus a per-file coverage summary (Node built-in)
node --import tsx --test tests/<name>.test.ts      # a single frontend test file
npm run test:backend                               # pytest backend/geolibre_server/tests
npm run test:backend:coverage                      # same, plus a pytest-cov term-missing report
python -m pytest backend/geolibre_server/tests/test_x.py::test_y   # a single backend test
npm run test:worker                                # typecheck workers/viewer
npm run test:e2e                                    # Playwright smoke tests (e2e/) against the built web app
npm run check:rust                                 # cargo check the Tauri crate
```

The `:coverage` variants run the same suites and print a coverage summary; CI
runs them so every build reports coverage. They are now **gated on a floor**:
`test:frontend:coverage` fails below 78% lines / 78% branches / 63% functions,
and `test:backend:coverage` fails below 55% (`--cov-fail-under`). The floors sit
a few points under the current numbers as a **ratchet** — regressions fail CI,
and when coverage rises comfortably above a floor, raise the floor to lock in the
gain. The frontend
report only counts files a test actually imports, so a module with no test does
not appear at all rather than as 0%. The backend coverage run (and `npm run ci`,
which calls the `:coverage` variants) needs `pytest-cov` from the backend `dev`
extra. Install the **`test`** extra to run the *full* backend suite — without
the optional engines (geopandas/rasterio/sedona/httpx) the vector/raster/SQL/ML
tests skip themselves and CI is green but hollow:
`pip install -e "backend/geolibre_server[test]"`.

`npm run test:e2e` builds the web app, serves it with `vite preview`, and drives
it with Playwright (`@playwright/test`). First run: `npx playwright install
chromium`. The webServer reuses an already-running preview locally and rebuilds
in CI; add specs under `e2e/`.

Dependencies are watched two ways: **Dependabot** (`.github/dependabot.yml`)
opens grouped weekly update PRs for npm, pip (backend + `python/`), cargo, and
Actions, and the CI **`audit` job** runs `npm audit --audit-level=high`
(blocking) plus a non-blocking `pip-audit` of the resolved backend environment.

The `python/` package has its own pytest suite (`cd python && pytest`) and is built into a wheel via `npm run build:embed` (produces `apps/geolibre-desktop/dist-embed`, consumed by `python/hatch_build.py`). Its version is dynamic, sourced from `python/src/geolibre/__init__.py`.

## Pre-commit

`.pre-commit-config.yaml` includes a **local `npm-build` hook**, so `pre-commit run` compiles the whole app — it is slow and can touch unrelated build state. Scope it to the files you changed: `pre-commit run --files <paths>`. Run it before pushing.

## Architecture (the parts that span files)

The app is **store-driven**. `@geolibre/core` holds the Zustand store, domain types, and the `.geolibre.json` project schema — it is the single source of truth. Data flows one way:

1. Data enters through the Add Data menus, Tauri dialogs, the browser file picker, drag-and-drop, or a plugin control.
2. Local vector files that MapLibre can't render directly are converted to GeoJSON in-browser by **DuckDB-WASM Spatial** (`INSTALL spatial; LOAD spatial;` → `ST_Read`; GeoParquet via the Parquet reader; zipped Shapefiles via `shpjs` with a DuckDB fallback; KMZ unzipped client-side). The result calls `addGeoJsonLayer`.
3. Tile/service/raster/ArcGIS/MBTiles/plugin layers become `GeoLibreLayer` records.
4. `MapCanvas` subscribes to `layers`; `MapController.syncLayers` (`@geolibre/map`) reconciles MapLibre sources/layers and the layer control. **You don't mutate MapLibre directly from UI** — you change store state and let sync apply it.

Rendering is MapLibre GL JS in the webview, with **deck.gl** for raster/point-cloud/3D overlays.

**Packages:** `@geolibre/core` (types, project format, store) · `@geolibre/map` (MapLibre lifecycle + layer sync) · `@geolibre/ui` (shadcn-style primitives) · `@geolibre/processing` (client-side algorithm registry) · `@geolibre/plugins` (plugin interface + built-in plugins) · `geolibre-desktop` (shell layout, Tauri I/O, composition).

**Plugins:** Built-in plugins live in `packages/plugins/src/plugins/`, are exported from that package's `index.ts`, and registered in `apps/geolibre-desktop/src/hooks/usePlugins.ts`. External plugins load from zips or a `plugin.json` manifest; bundled drop-ins under `apps/geolibre-desktop/public/plugins/<id>/` bake into both web and desktop builds. See `docs/plugin-api.md`.

**Python sidecar** (`backend/geolibre_server`, FastAPI on `127.0.0.1:8765`): backs the Whitebox toolbox, format Conversion tools, and Raster tools (rasterio). The desktop app starts it on demand. It is **optional** — Vector tools (Processing → Vector) run client-side with Turf.js and only use the sidecar's `/vector` endpoints (GeoPandas/Shapely) when the optional `vector` extra is installed; the dialog falls back to the client engine via `/vector/status`. Optional extras: `conversion`, `vector`, `raster`. Some conversions (PMTiles, Whitebox) are amd64-only.

The browser build proxies the sidecar at `/sidecar` (same-origin, no CORS); confined to `GEOLIBRE_CONVERSION_ROOTS` (default `/data`). Local MBTiles use a custom MapLibre protocol backed by Tauri commands.

## Conventions

- Never commit directly to `main`; branch and open a PR.
- Tauri CSP allowlists tile/style hosts (OpenFreeMap, CARTO) — new external map/tile hosts must be added there.
- Map/tile-host CORS for selected release assets is handled by a dev-server raster proxy.
- For MapLibre control styling fixes, add scoped overrides in `apps/geolibre-desktop/src/index.css`, never edit `node_modules`.
- UI strings are translatable via **react-i18next**; catalogs live in `apps/geolibre-desktop/src/i18n/locales/*.json` (`en.json` is the source of truth, typed by `i18next.d.ts`). Use `t()` for new user-facing strings; a `?locale`/`?lang` query param sets the embed language. See `docs/i18n.md`.
- Reference docs: `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/project-format.md`, `docs/plugin-api.md`, `docs/python.md`, `docs/i18n.md`, `docs/contributing.md`.
