    <h1>A lightweight, cloud-native GIS platform for visualizing, exploring, and analyzing geospatial data.</h1>
    <p class="hero__lead">
      GeoLibre is built with Tauri, React, TypeScript, MapLibre GL JS,
      DuckDB-WASM Spatial, and deck.gl. The same workspace runs across desktop
      and web environments, adapting responsively to mobile screens, with fast
      local and cloud-native data work, project files, styling, plugins, and
      modern geospatial workflows.

## What GeoLibre does today

<div class="feature-grid" markdown>

<div class="feature-card" markdown>
### MapLibre map workspace

Pan, zoom, rotate, and tilt a MapLibre map with OpenFreeMap basemaps or a blank background. Toggle built-in controls for navigation, globe, terrain, geolocation, scale, attribution, and logo, plus on-map tools like Measure, Bookmark, Minimap, View State, and Field Collection for capturing point, line, and polygon observations with a custom form by GPS or map tap.
</div>

<div class="feature-card" markdown>
### Local and remote data

Load local and remote vector and raster data, inspect and manage attributes in the table (add fields, a field calculator, a Charts panel, a field statistics summary, plus rename, hide, reorder, delete, and export to GeoJSON/GeoParquet/Shapefile/GeoPackage/CSV), style layers with single, categorized, graduated, and expression symbology (plus point heatmap and clustering renderers), organize the layer stack with collapsible groups, reorder, rename, and refresh layers with undo/redo, and save, reopen, or share `.geolibre.json` projects.
</div>

<div class="feature-card" markdown>
### Plugins and marketplace

Activate built-in plugins for layer control, basemaps, MapLibre components, swipe, street view, time slider, Overture Maps, LiDAR, GeoAgent, GeoEditor, and atmosphere effects, and install, update, or remove external plugins from the built-in marketplace.
</div>

<div class="feature-card" markdown>
### Advanced layer formats

Add Data covers XYZ, WMS, WFS, WMTS, ArcGIS, and STAC services; GeoParquet, FlatGeobuf, PMTiles, Zarr, and OpenStreetMap PBF; COG and GeoTIFF rasters, Cloud-Optimized NetCDF/HDF, and MBTiles; LiDAR, Gaussian splats, 3D Tiles (including authenticated tilesets), georeferenced video overlays, and deck.gl layers; and DuckDB and PostgreSQL databases.
</div>

<div class="feature-card" markdown>
### Conversion and Whitebox

Convert data to cloud-native GeoParquet, FlatGeobuf, PMTiles, and COG from the Conversion menu, and run batch geoprocessing with the Whitebox toolbox on the optional Python sidecar.
</div>

<div class="feature-card" markdown>
### SQL Workspace

Run DuckDB Spatial SQL in the browser against loaded layers, local files, and remote URLs, or query with the in-browser PostGIS engine powered by PGlite. Auto-wraps bare URLs into the matching reader and streams remote files over HTTP range requests. Includes sample queries, query history, and adding a result (with an optional layer name) to the map or exporting it as CSV or GeoParquet.
</div>

<div class="feature-card" markdown>
### Vector tools

Common geometry tools under Processing → Vector: buffer, centroids, convex hull, dissolve, bounding box, simplify, smooth, regular grid, Voronoi/Delaunay, clip, intersection, difference, union, spatial join, attribute join, select by value, select by location, and H3 hexagonal grids and binning. They run in the browser with Turf.js, with an optional GeoPandas sidecar engine for every tool. A Spatial Statistics toolbox and a batch runner with model/pipeline chaining round out Processing.
</div>

<div class="feature-card" markdown>
### Raster tools

Common raster tools under Processing → Raster: hillshade, slope, aspect, reproject, resample, clip by extent, clip by mask layer, polygonize, contour, zonal statistics, raster calculator, reclassify, mosaic, focal statistics, and a Spectral Index toolbox (NDVI, NDWI, EVI, and more with Sentinel-2, Landsat, and NAIP band presets). They run on a rasterio Python sidecar, with a client-side fallback for core tools when no sidecar is available. Pin a non-georeferenced image to the map with the Georeferencer (ground control points and an affine fit), style rasters with single-band pseudocolor classification or RGB band combination, and drag a GeoTIFF/COG onto the map to add it as a raster layer.
</div>

<div class="feature-card" markdown>
### Python and Jupyter

Embed the full GeoLibre app in a Jupyter notebook with the [`geolibre`](python.md) Python package. An expanded leafmap-style API (`add_geojson`, `add_tile_layer`, `add_cog`, local raster, marker/cluster, and choropleth layers, plus `split_map`, `add_legend`, `add_colorbar`, and `to_html`) drives the map, and the project syncs both ways so UI edits — including selected and drawn features — are readable back from Python. An in-app Python Console and automation API script the app directly, and a docked [Notebook panel](notebook.md) runs Jupyter beside the map (in-browser JupyterLite on the web, a desktop JupyterLab server) with cells driving the live map.
</div>

<div class="feature-card" markdown>
### AI Assistant

Chat with your data: a natural-language [assistant](user-guide/ai-assistant.md) that turns plain-English requests into GeoLibre's own operations — Spatial SQL, symbology, add/remove data, and map control — applied through the app so they stay auditable and undoable. Provider-pluggable (Google Gemini, Anthropic, OpenAI) with your own API key, disabled until configured.
</div>

<div class="feature-card" markdown>
### Collaboration and story maps

Edit the same project with others in real time ([collaboration](collaboration.md) MVP; requires `VITE_GEOLIBRE_COLLAB_URL`), and build scroll-driven [story maps](user-guide/storymaps.md) with a presenter view and standalone HTML export.
</div>

<div class="feature-card" markdown>
### Network analysis and geocoding

Compute isochrones, service areas, and origin–destination cost matrices for network analysis, and run forward, batch, and reverse [geocoding](user-guide/data-integrations.md#geocoding) through a multi-provider abstraction.
</div>

</div>

## Try it in the browser

The live demo is the browser-capable version of the GeoLibre desktop UI. It is useful for exploring the map, loading browser-selected vector data supported by DuckDB-WASM Spatial, adding URL-based layers, styling layers, and testing plugins. Desktop-only file dialogs, local MBTiles, local raster reads, and filesystem save/open operations still require the installed Tauri app.

!!! note "Hosted on GitHub Pages, private by design"
    The live demo is a static site deployed on GitHub Pages and runs entirely in your browser. It has no analytics and no server account, and the data you load is processed client-side in your browser session. Data leaves your browser only when you choose to add a remote URL or explicitly share a project.

Open a project by passing a public `.geolibre.json` URL with the `url` query parameter:

```text
https://viewer.geolibre.app/?url=https://share.geolibre.app/giswqs/3d-tiles.geolibre.json
```

For narrow embeds, add `?layout=compact` to the demo URL to use icon-only toolbar buttons and hide project metadata:

```text
https://viewer.geolibre.app/?url=https://share.geolibre.app/giswqs/3d-tiles.geolibre.json&layout=compact
```

For map-focused embeds, add `&panels=none` to hide the Layers, Style, and Attribute table panels:

```text
https://viewer.geolibre.app/?url=https://share.geolibre.app/giswqs/3d-tiles.geolibre.json&layout=compact&panels=none
```

Use `toolbar=icons` when you only want icon-only toolbar buttons. `panels=hidden`, `panels=hide`, `panels=off`, and `hidePanels=true` are accepted aliases for hiding panels.

For a fully chrome-free, map-only embed, add `&maponly` to hide the toolbar menu, all panels, and the status bar:

```text
https://viewer.geolibre.app/?url=https://share.geolibre.app/giswqs/3d-tiles.geolibre.json&maponly
```

Other parameters control the toolbar, panels, and theme. See [Embedding & Sharing](user-guide/embedding.md) for the full parameter reference and `<iframe>` examples.
